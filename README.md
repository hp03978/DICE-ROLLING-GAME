ABOUT THE GAME
Dice Rolling Game is a simple, turn-based Python game where 2 to 4 players compete to reach a target score of 50 by rolling a virtual six-sided die.
Rules of the Game:
Each player takes turns to roll the die as many times as they wish during their turn.
The player’s roll results are added to their current turn score.
Beware! Rolling a 1 ends the player's turn and resets their current turn score for that round to zero.
Players can choose to stop rolling at any time during their turn to secure their accumulated score and add it to their total score.
The first player to reach or exceed a score of 50 wins the game.
Features:
Input Validation: Ensures the game runs only for 2 to 4 players.
Random Rolls: Simulates a fair six-sided die using Python's random.randint function.
Turn-Based Play: Players take turns in sequence, making the game interactive.
Win Condition: The game automatically ends when a player reaches the target score.
How to Play:
Clone the repository and run the script in Python.
Enter the number of players when prompted (2–4 players).
Take turns rolling the die until one player wins by scoring 50 or more.
